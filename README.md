# Chemical Property Modelling for Cement Manufacturing Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing cement manufacturing by predicting the compressive strength of cement products based on their chemical properties. The dataset, provided by Ambuja Cement Company, includes chemical compositions and their respective material strengths. The goal was to build a predictive model that can help in manufacturing optimization by ensuring desired product strength.

This repository documents the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
